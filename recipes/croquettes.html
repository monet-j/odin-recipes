    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is my Oma's recipe. She immigrated from the Netherlands, and a lot of the food I had growing up was dutch. Croquettes (or these ones are technically bitterballen) were one of my absolute favourites.
    Mum used to eat leftover croquettes on toast the next day.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>340g mince</li>
        <li>30g butter</li>
        <li>30g flour</li>
        <li>3/4 C stock</li>
        <li>1 T fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 t fresh lemon rind, zested</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs or cornflake crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a veloute from the butter, flour, and stock.</li> 
        <li>Add the mince and seasonings and cook until the mince is no longer raw.</li>
        <li>Put the mixture on a plate, cover with cling film, and place in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Roll the mixture into balls and dip in a flour/water mix before rolling in crumbs.</li>
        <li>Deep fry until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
